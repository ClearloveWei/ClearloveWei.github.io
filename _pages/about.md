I am a third year undergraduate student in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn). I am currently working on the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning, advised by Professor [Haiming Jin](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~haimingjin/) at [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](jhc.sjtu.edu.cn).



I am broadly interested in machine learning and computer network's methods, algorithms and systems. Specifically, I am interested in (multi-agent) reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. My current project concerns multi-agent reinforcement learning's application on cyber-physical system.
